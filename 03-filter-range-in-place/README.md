Task 3: Filter Range in Place

Write a function filterRangeInPlace(arr, a, b) that gets an array arr and removes from it all values except those that are between a and b. The test is: a ≤ arr[i] ≤ b.

The function should only modify the array. It should not return anything.

For instance:

let arr = [5, 3, 8, 1];

filterRangeInPlace(arr, 1, 4); // removed the numbers except from 1 to 4

alert( arr ); // [3, 1]
