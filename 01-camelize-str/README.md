Task 1: 
Write the function camelize(str) that changes dash-separated words like “my-short-string” into camel-cased “myShortString”.

That is: removes all dashes, each word after dash becomes uppercased.

Examples
camelize("background-color") == 'backgroundColor';
camelize("list-style-image") == 'listStyleImage';
camelize("-webkit-transition") == 'WebkitTransition';


P.S. Hint: use split to split the string into an array, transform it and join back.
